ES6 Starterkit
==============

The future is today!

#### Usage

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. (Optional) Edit `package.json` if you intent to publish your package on `npm`.
3. `npm install` to install all the required dependencies from `npm`.
4. Hack `src/index.jsx` and `src/__tests__/index.jsx`.
5. Lint/test using `gulp`.
6. Don't forget to edit this `README.md` file.

Also don't forget that to run ES6 code, you need to perform `babel` transpiling. The recommended way is to use `babel/register` in `node` and the `babel` loader from `webpack` in the browser.

#### Features

- Sanely configured `gulpfile.js`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.eslintrc`, `.jsbeautifyrc`.
- Both CommonJS and ES6 modules are supported.
- Linting and testing is pre-configured.
- `lodash`, `bluebird` and `should` are included by default.
